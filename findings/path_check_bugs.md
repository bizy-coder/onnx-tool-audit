# onnx_tool 1.0.1 — bug catalog

Each test case runs through two oracles:

- **`onnxruntime`** executes the model. Validity is decided by execution: if ORT runs the model cleanly, it's a model that could ship. If ORT rejects it, we ignore the case — an unrunnable model can't be submitted to Kaggle and can't influence scoring.
- **`onnx_tool`** statically profiles the model.

Classification:

| ORT | onnx_tool | classification |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| reject | (any) | ignored (generator noise; not recorded here) |
| accept | reject | **onnx-tool-fails-valid-model** |
| accept | accept-but-disagrees | **onnx_tool wrong shape/dtype/bytes** |

**Summary**: 0 distinct onnx_tool bugs (0 surface findings collapsed).
